# Social Network API

## Description
This challenge was to develop and API for a social network that uses a NoSQL database. 

## Issue
The API is currently experiencing a bug that prevents it from fully working. I am still taking a look to see what is causing it to not be hosted to my local port.

## Getting Started
To run the API, follow these steps:
Clone the repository from GitHub.
Install the necessary dependencies using npm install.
Start the server using npm start

## Routes
The API provides the following routes once working:
GET routes for users and thoughts
POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users and thoughts

## Conclusion
Despite the current issue, the NoSQL Social Network API is a promising project that aims to provide a scalable and flexible solution for handling data for this challenge.
